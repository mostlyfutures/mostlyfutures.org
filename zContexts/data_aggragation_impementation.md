# Product Requirements Document: Data Aggregation & Visualization Platform

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the technical requirements and implementation strategy for developing a **data aggregation and visualization platform** inspired by RWA.xyz and Velo.xyz. These platforms excel at providing **real-time, interactive charts** and **aggregated data insights** for tokenized real-world assets and cryptocurrency trading data. The proposed solution will create a **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** that enables similar capabilities for your next project, focusing on **multi-source data ingestion**, **real-time processing**, and **customizable visualizations**. The platform will support both **blockchain-native data** and **traditional financial data sources**, with a particular emphasis on **user-configurable dashboards** and **API-first architecture** to enable broad integration capabilities.

## 1 Introduction & Product Objectives

### 1.1 Background Analysis

RWA.xyz has established itself as a **premier analytics platform** for tokenized real-world assets, providing comprehensive data on **tokenized treasuries**, **private credit**, **stablecoins**, and other RWA categories 【turn0search0】【turn0search10】. Their platform offers **industry-standard reference data** with powerful aggregation capabilities that allow users to analyze market trends, investor behavior, and ecosystem growth. Similarly, Velo.xyz provides **advanced trading analytics** with **real-time charting** capabilities powered by TradingView's technology, offering up to **10 data updates per second** and supporting **customizable layouts** with up to 16 panes and 32 indicators 【turn0search5】【turn0search6】.

| **API Usage** | Third-party integrations | 10+ external connections |

## 2 Data Sources & Ingestion Architecture

### 2.1 Primary Data Sources

Based on analysis of RWA.xyz and Velo.xyz, the platform must support **heterogeneous data sources**:

- **Blockchain Data**:
  - On-chain transaction data from multiple protocols
  - Token metadata and smart contract events
  - Liquidity pools and DeFi protocol data 【turn0search0】【turn0search7】

- **Market Data**:
  - Real-time price feeds from multiple exchanges
  - Trading volume and liquidity metrics
  - Derivatives data (funding rates, open interest, liquidations) 【turn0search5】

- **Reference Data**:
  - Asset metadata and classification systems
  - Investor and issuer information 【turn0search0】
  - Traditional financial data where applicable

### 2.2 Data Ingestion Framework

        D1[Time-Series DB]
        D2[Document Store]
        D3[Cache Layer]
    end
```

The ingestion framework will implement a **connector-based architecture** similar to GraphQL aggregation approaches 【turn0search1】【turn0search4】, enabling:

- **Standardized data connectors** for each source type
- **Schema validation** and **data normalization** during ingestion
- **Real-time stream processing** for time-sensitive data
- **Batch processing** for historical data backfills
- **Data quality monitoring** and **alerting mechanisms**

## 3 Data Processing & Aggregation

### 3.1 Aggregation Methodology

The platform will implement **multi-level aggregation** capabilities inspired by both platforms:

- **Time-based Aggregations**: OHLCV data, moving averages, cumulative metrics
- **Categorical Aggregations**: Grouping by asset, issuer, protocol, or other dimensions
- **Custom Calculations**: Derived metrics like premium, funding rates, volatility 【turn0search5】
- **Cross-chain Aggregation**: Combining data from multiple blockchain networks

### 3.2 Processing Engine Features

| Feature Type | Description | Implementation Approach |
|--------------|-------------|-------------------------|
| **Real-time Processing** | Sub-second data updates | Stream processing with Apache Kafka/Flink |
