# Create Git Commit

Create an atomic git commit with a properly formatted commit message following best practices for the uncommited changes or these specific files if specified.

read the project readme and run lint checks and unit tests

If checks and tests pass proceed, if they fail stop and report the failures

## Instructions

**Commit Message Format:**

- Use conventional commits: `<type>: <description>`
- Types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`
- Present tense (e.g., "add", "fix", "update", not "added", "fixed", "updated")
- 50 characters or less for the subject line
- Lowercase subject line
- No period at the end
- Be specific and descriptive

**Examples:**

- `feat: add web search tool with structured logging`
- `fix: resolve type errors in middleware`
- `test: add unit tests for config module`
- `docs: update CLAUDE.md with testing guidelines`
- `refactor: simplify logging configuration`
- `chore: update dependencies`

**Atomic Commits:**

- One logical change per commit
- If you've made multiple unrelated changes, consider splitting into separate commits
- Commit should be self-contained and not break the build

**IMPORTANT**

- NEVER mention claude code, anthropic, co authored by or anything similar in the commit messages

## Run

1. Review changes: `git diff HEAD`
2. Check status: `git status`
3. Stage changes: `git add -A`
4. Create commit: `git commit -m "<type>: <description>"`

## Report

- Output the commit message used
- Confirm commit was successful with commit hash
- List files that were committed
