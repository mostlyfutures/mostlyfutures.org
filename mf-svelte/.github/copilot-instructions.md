This is a SvelteKit project with TypeScript. When generating code:

- Use TypeScript for all new files
- Follow Svelte component conventions with `.svelte` file extensions
- Use SvelteKit's file-based routing system in the `src/routes` directory
- Prefer modern JavaScript/TypeScript features (ES6+)
- Use Svelte's reactive statements (`$:`) for derived state
- Follow component composition patterns with proper prop types
- Use Svelte stores for global state management when needed
- Maintain existing HTML structure and CSS styling when converting from HTML
- Use semantic HTML elements and maintain accessibility standards
