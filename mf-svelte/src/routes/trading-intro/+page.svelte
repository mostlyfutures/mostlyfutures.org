Trading uses these markets where you will be capitalizing off of the facilitation and the exchange of goods. The same way someone is willing to buy a fruit at a price is the same way a person is willing to buy a stock or commodity like a car. Once you start to associate a demand with every particular thing in life, trading becomes easier. People change their mind about how much they are willing to pay for things all the time, this is called demand. Every stock, car, piece of technology, or even a gold brick will always have demand for it at any given time, and trading is all about knowing when it's likely for demand of a product to go up or go down given the variety of factors related to the underlying product at the time.

      </p>      <p>    Stocks represent ownership of a company. This is kind of a weird concept to me still lowkey, but whenever you purchase shares, you own a piece of that business. The Stock price of a company is directly tied to it's ability to remain profitable and the demand of the company's services/products. Traders usually try to figure out if they can profit from a company's stock they believe to be undervalued by looking at price movements driven by earnings reports, market sentiment, macroeconomic factors, along with technical analysis.

Vice Versa, it might take a really long time to double your money with a asset you have invested in so people use something called futures to speed up the process. Instead of waiting 2 years to get double your money, a person can buy the "futures" of an asset to speed up their profit time.
